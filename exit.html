        This site is based on one of my first internet memories (and unintentionally, my first introduction to capitalism). Growing up on sites like MovieStarPlanet and Club Penguin, I quickly learned that cuter outfits and VIP badges often came with a price tag. Seal Star reimagines that world, where glitter meets gatekeeping and play meets paywalls.
